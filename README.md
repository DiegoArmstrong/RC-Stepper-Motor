# RC Stepper Motor

# Project Description

In this project, I developed a system to control a stepper motor's angle and direction using the Arduino Uno and DRV8825 driver. The goal was to create an intuitive user interface using Python's Tkinter library, enabling users to adjust the stepper motor's position and direction with ease.

The project involved wiring the Arduino Uno and DRV8825 driver, establishing the necessary connections with the stepper motor, and implementing the control logic. The Python-based GUI developed with Tkinter allowed users to interact with the system, specifying the desired angle and direction for the stepper motor.

# Hardware Understanding

Before you start creating or even thinking about your circuits, you first need to understand what kind of stepper motor you have and what that means for your circuit. The most common stepper motors are usually either 4-wired, 6-wired, or 8-wired.
